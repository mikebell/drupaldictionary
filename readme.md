#PHPStorm Drupal Dictionary
Some words are flagged as spelling mistakes (and rightly so!) by PHPStorm but are perfectly valid in Drupal

e.g. maxlength

This custom dictionary will stop them being flagged up and notify you if you really do spell it wrong.

#Install
1. Clone
2. Preferences > Spelling > Dictionaries > Add custom dictionary
3. Restart PHPStorm

#Help
Please fork this repo and help me add others to it.
